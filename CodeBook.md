Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
*************************************************************************************************************
Instructions:
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 
1) a tidy data set as described below, 
2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 
You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Tthe data for the project is available here:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

Download the Data:

fileUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"
download.file(fileUrl,destfile="./Dataset.zip")
setwd('C:/Users/Ranjana/Documents/Coursera/HumanActRecog');

unzip(zipfile="./Dataset.zip")
	path <- file.path("." , "UCI HAR Dataset")
	files<-list.files(path)

********************************************************************************************************
The script run_analysis.R performs the following steps as described in the course project's definition.

1. Load package reshape2. 
2. After unzipping the files, read the training data and test data from the files and assign column names to    the imported data.
3. Create the final test set by merging the xTest, yTest and subjectTest data.
4. Merge training and test data to create a final data set.
5. Extract the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
6. Label the data set with descriptive activity names. 
7. Create a 'tidy' data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject as output to    a CSV file.
