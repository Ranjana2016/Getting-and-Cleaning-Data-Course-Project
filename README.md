Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
*************************************************************************************************************
This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:
1. Downloads the dataset in the working directory
2. Unzips the files and reads the training data and test data from the files. 
3. Merges the training and test data to create a final data set.
4. Extract the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
5. Merge the finalData set with the acitivityType table to include descriptive activity names
6. Create a 'tidy' data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

The file tidy.txt. is the result after reunning run_analysis.R.
